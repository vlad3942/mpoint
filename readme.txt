Connect Docker container with external database
Add or edit the following line in your postgresql.conf :
listen_addresses = '*'

Add the following line as the first line of pg_hba.conf. It allows access to all databases for all users with an encrypted password:
# TYPE DATABASE USER CIDR-ADDRESS  METHOD
host  all  all 0.0.0.0/0 md5

edit the below line
 local   all             postgres                                peer
to
 local   all             postgres                                trust

sudo service postgresql restart
#Get host ip
ifconfig docker0

Use inet 172.17.0.1 as host. This may be different.

OR
use host = host.docker.internal
